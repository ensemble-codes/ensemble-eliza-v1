# Active Context: Ensemble Eliza v1

## Current Work Focus

### Memory Bank Creation (In Progress)
**Status**: Creating comprehensive Memory Bank structure for project documentation and context management.

**Completed**:
- âœ… Memory Bank directory structure created
- âœ… Project Brief established with core requirements and goals
- âœ… Product Context documented with problem statement and vision
- âœ… Technical Context outlined with stack and development setup
- âœ… System Patterns documented with architecture and design decisions

**In Progress**:
- ðŸ”„ Active Context documentation (this file)
- ðŸ”„ Progress tracking setup

**Next Steps**:
- Progress documentation to track what works and what needs building
- .cursorrules creation for project intelligence capture
- Initial project assessment to understand current implementation state

## Recent Changes

### Documentation Infrastructure
- Established complete Memory Bank structure following best practices
- Created foundational documentation covering all core aspects
- Set up hierarchical documentation that builds upon itself

### Project Understanding
- Identified this as an elizaOS-based multi-agent system
- Confirmed TypeScript-first development approach
- Recognized orchestrator pattern for agent coordination
- Mapped elizaOS plugin ecosystem integration

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Multi-Agent Pattern**: Confirmed orchestrator-hub model for agent coordination
- **Plugin Strategy**: Leverage elizaOS ecosystem rather than custom implementations
- **Documentation Approach**: Comprehensive Memory Bank for context preservation

### Development Priorities
1. **Foundation First**: Ensure solid documentation and understanding
2. **Testing Strategy**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage
3. **Extensibility**: Design for easy agent and plugin addition
4. **Production Readiness**: Build with deployment and maintenance in mind

### Technical Considerations
- elizaOS beta version compatibility management
- TypeScript strict mode adherence
- ESM module system consistency
- Plugin integration best practices

## Current Project State

### Known Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts           # Project entry point with agent registration
â”œâ”€â”€ plugin.ts          # Custom plugin definitions (6.4KB)
â”œâ”€â”€ tests.ts           # Test implementations (5.8KB)
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ orchestrator/  # Orchestrator agent directory
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ onii/         # Onii agent directory
â””â”€â”€ knowledge/        # Knowledge base directory
```

### Identified Components
- **Two Main Agents**: Orchestrator and Onii agents
- **Extensive Plugin Integration**: Multiple elizaOS plugins configured
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest setup with comprehensive testing
- **Build System**: tsup configuration for production builds

### Development Environment
- pnpm package manager in use
- TypeScript with strict configuration
- Git repository with active development (feat/post-twitter branch)
- Multiple configuration files for different tools

## Next Action Items

### Immediate (This Session)
1. Complete Progress documentation
2. Create .cursorrules for project intelligence
3. Assess current implementation state
4. Identify any missing or incomplete components

### Short Term
1. Review agent implementations for completeness
2. Validate plugin configurations
3. Ensure testing coverage is adequate
4. Check for any build or deployment issues

### Medium Term
1. Expand agent capabilities as needed
2. Add additional plugins if beneficial
3. Enhance testing scenarios
4. Improve documentation based on usage

## Context Notes
