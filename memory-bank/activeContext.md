# Active Context: Ensemble Eliza v1

## Current Work Focus

### Service Detail Action Refactor (Completed âœ…)
**Status**: Successfully refactored the Service Detail action to return structured JSON format.

**Completed**:
- âœ… Updated service data model to include predefined parameters
- âœ… Extended Onii agent's service configurations with parameter specifications
- âœ… Refactored action to return `service_details` JSON format instead of plain text
- âœ… Implemented proper service identification using LLM with fallback logic
- âœ… Added enhanced error handling that asks users for clarification
- âœ… Updated examples to demonstrate new JSON response format
- âœ… Added TypeScript interfaces for structured data types

**Key Features Implemented**:
- **JSON Response Format**: Returns structured `service_details` type with complete service information
- **Parameter Specifications**: Each service includes predefined parameters with requirements and descriptions
- **Smart Service Identification**: LLM identifies requested service or returns "UNCLEAR" for ambiguous requests
- **User Clarification**: When requests are unclear, provides helpful service list and asks for specifics
- **Address Generation**: Proper `from`/`to` fields using agent and user identifiers
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages

### Agent Services Action Implementation (Completed âœ…)
**Status**: Successfully implemented the Agent Services action based on provided specification.

**Completed**:
- âœ… Created comprehensive `src/actions/task.ts` following elizaOS Action pattern
- âœ… Implemented exact JSON response format from specification
- âœ… Added smart validation for service-related queries
- âœ… Integrated custom services configuration per agent
- âœ… Registered action in both Onii and Orchestrator agents
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite with multiple scenarios
- âœ… Added proper error handling and fallback responses
- âœ… Exported action through centralized actions index

**Key Features Implemented**:
- **Spec Compliance**: Exact `agent_services` type response with required fields
- **Configurable Services**: Each agent can define custom services via `AGENT_SERVICES` setting
- **Smart Validation**: Detects service-related questions with keyword and pattern matching
- **Default Fallback**: Provides default services if none configured
- **Human-Readable Output**: Beautiful formatted service menu with pricing
- **Structured Data**: Includes both text response and structured JSON for other systems

### Memory Bank Creation (Completed âœ…)
**Status**: Comprehensive Memory Bank structure created and maintained.

**Completed**:
- âœ… Memory Bank directory structure created
- âœ… Project Brief established with core requirements and goals
- âœ… Product Context documented with problem statement and vision
- âœ… Technical Context outlined with stack and development setup
- âœ… System Patterns documented with architecture and design decisions
- âœ… Active Context documentation (this file)
- âœ… Progress tracking setup and maintenance

## Recent Changes

### Service Detail Action Refactor
- Enhanced service data model to include parameters for each service
- Updated Onii agent with comprehensive parameter specifications for all services:
  - **Bull Post**: project_name, key_features, target_audience parameters
  - **Twitter Thread**: topic, thread_length, tone parameters  
  - **Stream Consultation**: platform, content_type, current_setup parameters
- Implemented structured JSON response matching exact `service_details` specification
- Added intelligent service identification with fallback to user clarification
- Replaced plain text responses with structured data for API consumption

### Service Configuration Enhancement  
- Extended `AGENT_SERVICES` format to include `parameters` array
- Standardized parameter structure with `name`, `required`, and `description` fields
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing service definitions

### Agent Services Implementation
- Created robust action following established patterns from existing Twitter post action
- Added Onii-specific services (Blessings, Bull Posts, Twitter Threads, etc.)
- Added Orchestrator-specific services (Workflow Design, Agent Coordination, etc.)
- Implemented comprehensive validation using multiple keywords and patterns
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for service definitions and responses

### Testing Infrastructure
- Created full test suite covering validation, handler execution, and error cases
- Fixed TypeScript compatibility issues with vitest and elizaOS types
- Added proper mock objects following elizaOS Memory and State interfaces

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Implementation Decisions Made
- **Parameter Definition**: Parameters are predefined in service configuration for consistency
- **Field Naming**: Standardized on `name` field for parameter identifiers
- **Service Identification**: Maintained LLM-based identification with enhanced prompting
- **Response Format**: Pure JSON output without human-readable text for API consumption
- **Error Strategy**: User clarification requests for ambiguous or invalid service requests
- **Address Format**: Agent-based identifiers using `{agentName}.ensemble` pattern

### Architecture Decisions Confirmed
- **Multi-Agent Pattern**: Successfully extended orchestrator-hub model
- **Plugin Strategy**: Continued leveraging elizaOS ecosystem patterns
- **Documentation Approach**: Memory Bank proven effective for context preservation
- **Action Pattern**: Following established elizaOS Action interface consistently

## Current Project State

### Recently Added Components
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ actions/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts      # NEW: Action exports
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ task.ts       # NEW: Agent Services action (7.4KB)
test/
â””â”€â”€ agentServices.test.ts  # NEW: Comprehensive test suite
```

### Updated Components
```
src/agents/
â”œâ”€â”€ orchestrator/index.ts  # UPDATED: Added services config and action registration
â””â”€â”€ onii/index.ts         # UPDATED: Added services config and action registration
```

### Enhanced Capabilities
- **Service Discovery**: Agents can now present their available services on request
- **Pricing Information**: Services include pricing in credits with descriptions
- **Agent Identification**: Services properly identify which agent is providing them
- **API Integration**: Structured responses enable other systems to consume service data

## Next Action Items

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. âœ… Review implementation completeness and quality
