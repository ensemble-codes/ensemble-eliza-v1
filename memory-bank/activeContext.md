# Active Context: Ensemble Eliza v1

## Current Work Focus

### Agent Services Action Implementation (Completed âœ…)
**Status**: Successfully implemented the Agent Services action based on provided specification.

**Completed**:
- âœ… Created comprehensive `src/actions/task.ts` following elizaOS Action pattern
- âœ… Implemented exact JSON response format from specification
- âœ… Added smart validation for service-related queries
- âœ… Integrated custom services configuration per agent
- âœ… Registered action in both Onii and Orchestrator agents
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite with multiple scenarios
- âœ… Added proper error handling and fallback responses
- âœ… Exported action through centralized actions index

**Key Features Implemented**:
- **Spec Compliance**: Exact `agent_services` type response with required fields
- **Configurable Services**: Each agent can define custom services via `AGENT_SERVICES` setting
- **Smart Validation**: Detects service-related questions with keyword and pattern matching
- **Default Fallback**: Provides default services if none configured
- **Human-Readable Output**: Beautiful formatted service menu with pricing
- **Structured Data**: Includes both text response and structured JSON for other systems

### Memory Bank Creation (Completed âœ…)
**Status**: Comprehensive Memory Bank structure created and maintained.

**Completed**:
- âœ… Memory Bank directory structure created
- âœ… Project Brief established with core requirements and goals
- âœ… Product Context documented with problem statement and vision
- âœ… Technical Context outlined with stack and development setup
- âœ… System Patterns documented with architecture and design decisions
- âœ… Active Context documentation (this file)
- âœ… Progress tracking setup and maintenance

## Recent Changes

### Agent Services Implementation
- Created robust action following established patterns from existing Twitter post action
- Added Onii-specific services (Blessings, Bull Posts, Twitter Threads, etc.)
- Added Orchestrator-specific services (Workflow Design, Agent Coordination, etc.)
- Implemented comprehensive validation using multiple keywords and patterns
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for service definitions and responses

### Testing Infrastructure
- Created full test suite covering validation, handler execution, and error cases
- Fixed TypeScript compatibility issues with vitest and elizaOS types
- Added proper mock objects following elizaOS Memory and State interfaces

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Implementation Decisions Made
- **Configuration Strategy**: Services defined in agent settings as JSON strings for flexibility
- **Validation Approach**: Combined keyword detection with question patterns for accuracy
- **Response Format**: Dual format - human-readable text plus structured data for API consumers
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive coverage including edge cases and error scenarios

### Architecture Decisions Confirmed
- **Multi-Agent Pattern**: Successfully extended orchestrator-hub model
- **Plugin Strategy**: Continued leveraging elizaOS ecosystem patterns
- **Documentation Approach**: Memory Bank proven effective for context preservation
- **Action Pattern**: Following established elizaOS Action interface consistently

## Current Project State

### Recently Added Components
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ actions/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts      # NEW: Action exports
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ task.ts       # NEW: Agent Services action (7.4KB)
test/
â””â”€â”€ agentServices.test.ts  # NEW: Comprehensive test suite
```

### Updated Components
```
src/agents/
â”œâ”€â”€ orchestrator/index.ts  # UPDATED: Added services config and action registration
â””â”€â”€ onii/index.ts         # UPDATED: Added services config and action registration
```

### Enhanced Capabilities
- **Service Discovery**: Agents can now present their available services on request
- **Pricing Information**: Services include pricing in credits with descriptions
- **Agent Identification**: Services properly identify which agent is providing them
- **API Integration**: Structured responses enable other systems to consume service data

## Next Action Items

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. âœ… Review implementation completeness and quality
2. âœ… Validate test coverage and error handling
3. ðŸ”„ Consider additional agent capabilities or actions needed
4. ðŸ”„ Assess overall project readiness

### Short Term
1. Review other existing actions for completeness and patterns
2. Validate agent coordination mechanisms
3. Assess knowledge base content and structure
4. Test full system integration

### Medium Term
1. Expand agent capabilities based on usage patterns
2. Add additional actions following established patterns
3. Enhance testing scenarios for coordination
4. Document deployment and maintenance procedures

## Implementation Success Indicators

### Technical Success âœ…
- Action follows elizaOS patterns perfectly
- Comprehensive test coverage achieved
- Type safety maintained throughout
- Error handling covers edge cases
- Both agents successfully configured

### Specification Compliance âœ…
- Exact JSON format match: `type: "agent_services"`
- Required fields: `from`, `to`, `content.data.services`
- Optional fields: `agent_name`, `message` properly included
- Service structure matches spec exactly

### Integration Success âœ…
- Action registered in multiple agents
- Custom services per agent working
- Default fallback services functional
- Validation working across different query types

## Context Notes

### elizaOS Integration Learnings
