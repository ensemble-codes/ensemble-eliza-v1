# Project Brief: Ensemble Eliza v1

## Overview
`ensemble-eliza-v1` is an elizaOS-based project implementing a multi-agent system with specialized agents working in coordination. The project serves as both a practical implementation and a foundation for building sophisticated AI agent ecosystems.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Implement a system where multiple specialized agents can work together efficiently
- **Plugin Integration**: Leverage elizaOS plugin ecosystem for extended functionality
- **Scalable Architecture**: Design patterns that support adding new agents and capabilities
- **Production Ready**: Include proper testing, build processes, and deployment capabilities

### Key Agents
1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates and manages communication between other agents
2. **Onii Agent**: Specialized agent with specific domain responsibilities

### Technical Foundation
- **Framework**: elizaOS v1.0.0-beta.32+
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build System**: tsup
- **Testing**: Vitest with coverage
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Functional multi-agent system with proper coordination
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Clear documentation and memory bank
- [ ] Deployable and maintainable codebase
- [ ] Plugin extensibility demonstrated

## Project Scope
This project focuses on creating a foundational multi-agent system that can be extended and customized for various use cases. It's designed to be both a working example and a starting point for more complex agent implementations.

## Constraints
- Must work within elizaOS framework constraints
- TypeScript-first development
- Maintain compatibility with elizaOS plugin ecosystem
- Follow elizaOS architectural patterns
